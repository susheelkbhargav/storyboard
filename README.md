# storyboard
I would be working on a project in machine learning and virtual reality.  It’s basically a story board where the images are automatically generated on-the-go when a person is reading a book aloud or narrating something. The system processes the voice input of the user, understands the context and generates the images. These images will be outlines of the objects that are mentioned in the input.  For example, if the user says, “a man is running on a bridge”. A generic outline of a person is seen running on a generic outline of a bridge. The more detailed the user’s input, the more detailed will be the images. If the user wants to narrate a story, the output will be similar to a rough draft or outline of an animation movie.
